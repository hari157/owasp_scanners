Here is my Open Web Application Security  Project which scans various website and gives the result whether the given link is secure or not

A Vulnerability Scanner is a computer program designed to access computers , networks or application for known weakness which is build using a python programming language. Most, commonly used approach is the vulnerability assessment . By vulnerability scanner , I can identify the potential flaws in the web application or networks that make it prone to attack. Assessment of these webpage vulnerabilities (SQL Injection, Cross-site Scripting, CRLF Injection) provides a mean to identify and develop new strategies so as to protect the system from the risk of being damaged. This project focuses on the usage of SQL Injection, Cross-site Scripting and CRLF Injection scanners and their related methodology to detect the SQL Injection, Cross-site Scripting and CRLF Injection available in the web applications or the remote host across the network and tries to identify new mechanisms that can be deployed to secure the network.

The below snapshot clearly shows that the below website is notb vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting attack
